I am inside my room with two dark curtains on either side keeping it dark. The lighter one in the middle allows just enough light to make me want to peek outside the window. I couldn’t do that, or it didn’t seem important. I am lying on my bed. I dragged my water bottle, lifted, opened the lid, kept one hand at the top while lifting the bottom. I had to push down with my mouth to make it tilt. I had the strength of a 2-year-old. Suddenly I felt the compulsion to vigorously move my chest back and forth, like possessed by a demon. I was not scared but mildly surprised. This motion though seemed controllable at times was satisfying. Soon accompanied by hysteric laughter, this took a new aura. Psychologically it’s a feeling of being bathed in extraordinary realizations far more than my mind can process. The sheer load of the experience felt like my mind expanding in real-time."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Acknowledge and accept all human drives. The tension between ‘culturally accepted’ and ‘evolutionarily primed’ behaviors creates unnecessary fatigue and misery. Evolutionary forces generate strong drives that we suppress or accept based on the cultural imagination. Breaching those norms leaves us feeling ashamed and guilty. We adjust our thoughts and behaviors to fit into the culture, often in very subtle ways. Mentally note or record in a journal the instances when you felt the slightest tinge of guilt or indulged in behaviors that you are not happy with. Now, accept that this, by definition, is part of human nature. Sometimes mere social baggage creates unnecessary friction against evolutionary drives. Perhaps the advantage of sticking to cultural norms is not worth it. Noticing vast differences in cultural norms across the globe can provide a different perspective. Guilt is a bad feeling and cannot be endured for long, so our brains invent reasons to escape it.\nAll behaviors that are against our well-being are sustained either by this escape mechanism or through our complete unawareness of their effects. Only an inquisitive and open mind has the luxury of discovering behaviors in the second category. The creation of the ego is an apt example. Raising our awareness is the only way to open the possibility of improving our well-being.\nHeightened experience of life doesn’t come from grabbing better beliefs and ideologies. Beliefs offer certainty. Our brains are ill-equipped to deal with probabilities. So, a well-formed belief or opinion might serve as a good heuristic. But, Beliefs concerning oneself create an identity.It only creates angst and unnecessary dissatisfaction. It also has the side-effect of pushing life in the background. It feeds on the stability of its beliefs. It works only in the realm of thoughts – It strives to engross and fit everything in its tiny bubble. Any amount of brooding or theorization over this only can burst one to creates newer and more subtle ones. Non-judgemental awareness of this process loosens the hold. At this heightened level of perception, life happens on a different dimension."

If an idea filters through this process successfully, it can be considered further. Don’t fool yourself here,if you aren’t willing to pay chances are nobody will. The second category is much simpler.

Measure your day by how much of it is intentional. There are always people and things constantly attempting to grab your attention – the News, Internet, fancy toys. It’s a skill that can be trained."

The desired mental states we all seek are similar. In life, we try to line it up with certain mental states while avoiding others. This is the origin of all our desires. So it seems pertinent to find out the controller of these states? From where do they arise ? Does pre-conditions matter to get into a certain state ?"

All the sensations that we derive from indulging in work, thoughts will be experienced now. So the scope of our life depends on our capacity to experience now. It’s a strange realization\nLife is happening now. Whether I plan for future, muse on my past or feel the burning pain of my wound , It all happens right now and that’s all I got. A moment arises within the cessation of the previous one. There is no way to latch. In thinking about the future – all my sensations whether the excitement or the dread happens in the present. So it follows whether can I keep myself joyful right now – without the necessity of a person, thing, belief or ideology. That would be cool."

    "text": "Love\nA heart brimming with love and a radiant body are necessary to experience life to its fullest. Love doesn’t require anything outside one’s agency. It doesn’t demand people to be less mean nor does it require us to constantly seek justification in their actions. It doesn’t arise from any expectation of oneself or others. Whoever is around you, the habit of having good intentions for their life creates immediate well-being. Giving your best to a task, such as playing football for your team, might involve strategizing against your opponent. However, it doesn’t require you to change your intentions. It only becomes a zero-sum game when you place your source of joy outside yourself—like in winning a game or getting a promotion. Then, inevitably, subtle forms of hate arise, helping us navigate dissatisfaction. But this leaves us incapable of experiencing true joy."

    "text": "Belief\nBelief is easy. It demands no cognitive load, and decisions are made almost unconsciously. Doubt, on the other hand, requires deliberation. Belief is common; it brings people together and offers safety. Groups welcome or ostracize individuals based on shared beliefs, and evolution further selects these individuals. The desire to be identified with a group is a natural, ever-present force, raising our odds of survival in the wild. However, our well-being depends on maintaining a fine balance between Doubt and Belief."

Our desires come out of deep dissatisfaction with the present and hope to escape from it in the future. But this is a ceaseless process, always keeps us tethered to the future. It’s funny that life always happens now."
