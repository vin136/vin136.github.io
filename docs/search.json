Now, once you choose a few, write down how much you are willing to pay and the kind of service or the product you want. If an idea filters through this process successfully, it can be considered further. Don’t fool yourself here,if you aren’t willing to pay chances are nobody will. The second category is much simpler. Choose an industry. (better you already got some idea about it.).Now find out what’s happening within it in other countries. Read their magazines, news sites, etc. Now the question boils down to, What successful business products and models can you take inspiration from? Yes, that’s called copying ideas.
